# The Doggo App - Nuxt.js

This is the upgrade to the Doggo App written in `Vue.js` from an [existing repository](https://github.com/Imran-Sehic/doggo-app-vue) just rewritten in `Nuxt.js` using the composition API.

The original repository of the Doggo App written in `React.js` and `Next.js` is [here](https://github.com/Imran-Sehic/doggo-app).
